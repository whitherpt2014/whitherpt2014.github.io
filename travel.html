<h2 class="section-title">Travel to Cambridge</h2>

<p><a href="index.html">Back to conference website</a>
</p>
         <p><strong>Train: </strong>Cambridge can be reached via train from
            a large number of towns and cities in the UK, and there is a very
            regular service between Cambridge
            and London which takes approximately one hour. Further timetable
            and fare information is available from the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National
            Rail </a> website.</p>
          <p>The train station is an approx. 20 minute walk from the city
            centre. City buses run from the train station to the city centre every ten minutes. Cambridge city bus routes can be found
<a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/downloads/file/28/cambridge_city_bus_map"> here</a>.


 
            There is also a taxi rank outside the station which, again, is to
            your right as you exit the station.</p>


          <p> <strong>Bus: </strong>The central drop-off point for bus services
            to Cambridge is at the city bus station on Drummer Street. National Express operates a coach service from a large
            number of towns and cities in the UK, including a regular service
            from London Victoria coach station, and provides an airport shuttle
            service. Full information about
            bus routes and timetables can be found at  at <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx">their website</a>.
</p>


         <!-- <p><strong>Car:</strong> The main routes into Cambridge and locations
            of University and College buildings are marked on the <a href="img/Cambridge_map.pdf">University
            map</a>. Cambridge is a very busy city with poor parking facilities.
            Please bear this in mind when planning your journey. There is no
            parking available at the conference venue. If you are staying overnight,
            your hotel may be able to offer you parking facilities. If you wish
            to use your car and are not staying overnight, we recommend you use
            the Park &amp; Ride sites instead of bringing your car into the city
            centre.  If you have a disability or condition which means that car parking
at the venue is essential, please do contact us, in advance, by
<a href="mailto:amlap2008@csl.psychol.cam.ac.uk">e-mail</a>.</p>

          <p><strong> Taxi:</strong> There is a taxi rank at the train station.
            If you wish to call a taxi during your stay in Cambridge, we recommend
            Panther Taxis (01223 715715).</p>


          <p> <strong>Air:</strong> <br />
              <em>London Stansted Airport:</em><br />
  This is the closest airport to Cambridge which offers scheduled flights, at
  a distance of approx 30 miles from Cambridge. It is well served by airlines
  from many European destinations. Information on flights can be found <a href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Cambridge is easily reached by rail or coach from Stansted. There
            is a railway station inside the terminal at Stansted and the direct
            journey to Cambridge takes approximately 30 minutes. A regular direct
            coach service runs to Cambridge and takes approximately 1 hour. </p>
          <p><em>London Luton Airport:</em><br />
  Luton Airport is also quite close to Cambridge (35 miles) and receives a number
    of flights from European destinations, mainly those operated by budget airlines.
    The journey from Luton to Cambridge is less favourable than that from Stansted.
    The coach journey can take between 1&frac12; and 3&frac12; hours, depending
    on the time of day. The train from Luton is via London and is not direct
    to Cambridge, and the station is in the centre of Luton rather than at the
    airport.</p>
          <p><em>London Heathrow Airport:</em><br />
  Heathrow is the main airport in the UK, and is well-serviced by both European
    and international flights. Cambridge can be reached by a direct coach from
    the airport which takes approx. 2&frac12; hours, although is often longer
    due to traffic on the main London ring-road. There is a train station within
    the airport terminal from which the regular Heathrow Express train connects
    to London Paddington station. From there you need to take the underground
    to either London Kings Cross or London Liverpool Street to get a train onto
    Cambridge.</p>
          <p><em>London Gatwick Airport:</em><br />
  Gatwick airport is the furthest London airport from Cambridge, being located
    on the south of London. Cambridge can be reached by a direct coach from the
    airport which takes approx. 4 hours. There is a train station in the airport
    terminal from which the regular Gatwick Express train connects to Victoria
    train station in London. From there you need to take the underground to either
    London Kings Cross or London Liverpool Street to get a train onto Cambridge. </p>
